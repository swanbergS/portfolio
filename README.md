# csce494project

This is a project created by myself and 3 other group members. To access the main file, go to lib and then click main. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out!
This project is a stock market meets fantasy football style app where a user can create their own team, create their own lineup of stocks, set their shares, and compete to gain the most money. While this is currently just a prototype, I hope you enjoy the app!
